#Some Jupyter Notebook examples

A set of notebooks developed for use in teaching or just showing off the notebook.

##Interactive elements
Most of these notebooks have interactive elements. If you are viewing them via guthub, the sliders etc don't appear -- not even statically. You need to load the notebooks into Jupyter for them to work.

##List of notebooks
* MultiLanguage/MultiLangStats (R, MATLAB, Python) - Parallel monte carlo done in three languages. Written before Jupyter was released and uses cell magics and various bridges between each language and Python.
* physics/Fourier Series (Python) - Interactive widget that computes fourier series of a square wave
* physics/KronigPenney.ipynb (Python) - Interactive widget calculating the bandstructure of the Kronig Penny model. Also shows how you embedded YouTube video.
